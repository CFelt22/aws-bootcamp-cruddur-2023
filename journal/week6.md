## Open Up The Cloud Homework

### Dreams and fears of an hiring manager
As a hiring manager, I also want someone with good social skills. They need to be able to explain their ideas and defend them. Being able to defend their ideas also means being able to accept criticism and listen to others' ideas. I want someone who is able to work in a team, share knowledge and information, and who can help the enterprise grow. My biggest fear is hiring someone who is not able to work in a team and collaborate. Someone who thinks their ideas are always the best and becomes angry when their ideas are not followed. It's easier to teach someone missing knowledge than it is to make them work as a team.

### Resume
This is the kind of strucutre that I would use the next time I will apply for a job.

### Credibility matrix
This is my credibility matrix. At the moment, I do not have any certifications. I build my knowledge from courses found online. This is so far the basic knowledge that I learned from the past two years.

### Identify opportunities to move up
Since I do not have an IT education, I am looking to improve my basic IT knowledge. This is why I am doing this bootcamp; I wanted to have a better overview of what is needed for the development of an application. After that, I will work towards obtaining the Advanced Networking certification for my current job. Then, I plan on pursuing the SysOps Administrator certification. Having some certifications will help establish my credibility since I am transitioning to a new career path. Additionally, I plan on working on personal projects to develop applications, which will help me apply for higher-level jobs.
