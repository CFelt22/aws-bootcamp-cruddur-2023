# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing
This week, the tasks were a bit harder. It was quite complicated to send the traces to Honeycomb, Rollbar or X-ray. I grouped some information to make it shorter to read.
## 1. Adding the environment variables for the tracing.
I added the different variables to be sure that the tracing will work.
[docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/CFelt22/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml)

## 2. Adding the modules for tracing.
I added the needed modules in the requirements.txt file so they are installed at launch.

## 3. Adding code in the app.py file.
I added needed code to allow tracing to work. I added code for Honeycomb, Rollbar and X-Ray.
[App.py](https://github.com/CFelt22/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/backend-flask/app.py)

## 4. Adding the tracers in the home_activities.py file.
I added the tracers to send data to honeycomb. I diddn't let the debug tracers, it caused me some problems.

## 5. Receiving data in Honeycomb.
After some credentials problems when the container was up, I finally got data.

## 6. Creating the xray.json file and adding code.
This is used to create a log group in CloudWatch.
[xray.json](https://github.com/CFelt22/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/aws/json/xray.json)

## 7. Adding subsegment in the notifications_activities.py file.
I decided to add the code in this file because it was Andrew's first intention.
[notifications_activities.py](https://github.com/CFelt22/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/backend-flask/services/notifications_activities.py)
![notifications_activities.py](/journal/assets/Notifications_w2.png "notifications_activities.py")
## 8. Adding the logger to app.py and home_activities.py

## 9. Receiving data in X-Ray and CloudWatch

## 10. Receiving data in Rollbar

## 11. My journey to the cloud
Since two years, I changed career and I had the oportunity to learn AWS while working. I'm an ASEA SysAdmin (AWS Secure Environment Accelerator). I had no real prior background in IT. I was in video production and I learned many software by myself.
