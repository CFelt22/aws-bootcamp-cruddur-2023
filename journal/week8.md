# Week 8 â€” Serverless Image Processing
This week was about implementing the user profile page. First we used CDK to deploy a S3 Bucket and a Lambda function that format the uploaded profile avatars images. Then we added the popup user profile info and make it possible to save the informations in the local db. We created a CloudFront distribution to cache the images.
